### Background of SASEUL
---
First, Bitcoin and Ethereum are too inefficient in mining, which is a necessary process for consensus. In addition, fossil fuels used to develop electric energy, the basis of computing power consumed for mining, pose environmental problems such as increased carbon dioxide emissions. SASEUL was developed to solve this problems.

Second, a little over a decade has passed since blockchain technology was known to the world by Bitcoin, the first-generation blockchain. Since then, numerous similar blockchain technologies have been rampant after Ethereum. However, no technology has overcome the shortcomings of the existing technology, highlighting only coins, lowering the technical value of the blockchain itself. At a time when all kinds of frauds are taking place using such difficult blockchain technology, SASEUL was developed to show the value of real blockchain.
